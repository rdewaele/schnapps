NOTE: lpc21isp is not released as a compressed source folder, but as compressed
      source _files_. The Makefile takes this into account and recompresses the
      source, so it becomes a compressed source _folder_, which is necessary for
      compatibility with the main toolchain Makefile. If you provide your own
      version of lpc21isp, take this into account!

This is the directory where the source tarballs go for the software supported
by the makefile.
Currently, upstream tested versions are:

	binutils-2.22.tar.xz
